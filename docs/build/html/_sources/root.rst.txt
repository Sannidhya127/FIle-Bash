Rooter
======

Rooter is an issue tracking utility written in Python for testing File Bash. The development of Rooter has recently begun and shall require some time to complete. The full scan command for File Bash, *rooter -sc 0* is under development. A lot of functions have been added to the scanner but some are yet to be done. APIs are also tested in this procedure.
