Quickstart Guide to the use of a Bash
=====================================

The following tutorial will help you understand how a terminal system or a bash works and how to use it. For reference, we will use File Bash as the default terminal of learning

The Interface
-------------

On launching the File Bash Terminal you will observe an interface similar to this:

>>> C:\Users\USER\NiceFolder\AnotherNiceFolder:

In the above line we see a path given with a colon at the end. Towards the other side of the colon is the point where the user enters his/her desired command to the terminal and recieves the desired result unless a wrong command is passed. The path that we see is the current working directory, i.e, the folder in which the terminal is currently open.



Basic Commands (Visit :doc:`commands` page for details)
-------------------------------------------------------

Some of the most basic commands of the bash are :ref:`ls <ls>` (lists all directory items), :ref:`rm <rm>` (deletes given item), :ref:`mv <mv>` (renames given item with a new name from user)
