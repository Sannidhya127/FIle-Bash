File Bash Documentation
=======================

**File Bash** is a simple command line interface application developed and maintained in *The Python Programming Language*. Inspired by the *Linux Terminal* and the *Windows Powershell*, File Bash tries to frame the basic commands of a command prompt coded completely in python. The project is not intended to be deployed for public use but for a better practise of python and project management.

*Is there any practical use of this project?*

Yes, there are suffice reasons to justify the practical use of this project. This project might not be worth market value as there tons of free softwares like this. But this project can certainly be used for educational purposes. Every functionality of this cmd has been codes completely in python without plagiarism or modules that make things in just one line (except of core-python modules like os, time, win32, etc). Programmers can certainly study the code and also make contributions to the code and its logic.
