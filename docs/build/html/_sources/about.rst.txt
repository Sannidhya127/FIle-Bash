The Bash
********

File Bash is a practise project developed and maintained in Python with the intentions of mastering the basic python concepts.
The project initially began as a command line input reciever with some basic commands. The project used several well-known and some less known python modules for the most effective implementation of python code and logic. Emphasis shall be laid to the fact that easy one-line solutions to the problems with the help of simple modules were not opted for this project, a rather lengthy and basic python code with proper logic and error handling has been used for this purpose. For eg, to delete a file I could easily accomplish it by using the subprocess module, which would solve the issue in one line, but the more educational and better way was chosen. The entire function has been coded without any make-easy modules. Subprocess has only been used to interpret python and git commands.

The Documentation
*****************

The File Bash Documentation is a recent addition to the File Bash project. This documentation is primarily an educational-software documentation. It intends to provide a simplified explanation of File Bash's functionalities as well as its code. The documentation is built using Sphinx, a python moudle specially developed for making documentations using RestructeredText. The development and maintainance of this documentation is taken over by the Sannidhya127. Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer effort, just like File Bash itself. If you want to contribute, please take a look at the :doc:`contribute` page for information on how to do so. New volunteers are always welcome!

Rooter
******

Rooter is a testing device written in Python used for testing File Bash. Still under development, rooter aims to function as a command line utility that will check each and every File Bash function and carefully note the reports for further debugging. A more detailed documentation of Rooter can be found at :doc:`root`
