File Bash Documentation
=======================

**File Bash** is a simple command line interface application developed and maintained in *The Python Programming Language*. Inspired by the *Linux Terminal* and the *Windows Powershell*, File Bash tries to frame the basic commands of a command prompt coded completely in python. Why File Bash is interesting?

- It provides a proper python code logic, independent of internet reference used to code the commands coded in C in powershell or terminal (Linux).

- It has a secret command that you can find out for some fun

- A stable git and python/pip support
