File Bash Documentation
=======================

**File Bash** is a simple command line interface application developed and maintained in *The Python Programming Language*. Inspired by the *Linux Terminal* and the *Windows Powershell*, File Bash tries to frame the basic commands of a command prompt coded completely in python. The project is not intended to be deployed for public use but for a better practise of python and project management.
