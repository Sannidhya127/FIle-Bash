About the author
================

I don't really think you would be much interested in learning about me, so I will just provide a basic set of details about me.

I am born and brought up in Kolkata, India. Forcing my way in this world in 2007, I am 14 years now (probably). I study in St. Xavier's Collegiate School, Kolkata.

I have my primary knowledge in python. Other than that I know quite a bit of PHP, some JavaScript, C/C++, basic concepts of ruby and java. I don't think HTML and CSS are worth mentioning. (Stop asking me abt Qbasic nerds) 

I made some cool projects in python as well as other Languages. Unfortunately most project you find in my github profile are python. The cool php forum site I made was in my previous github account which some stupid github bot banned for no damn reason. So, be content with my new account. 

I think this enough knowledge about me. Thank You :)
