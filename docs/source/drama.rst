The following is a short drama for some entertainment, I am not responsible if you don't like it. Thats your mental issue.


*The user has launched file bash and is ready for issueing a command. The bloody guy decides to run ls*

*The comd variable and the modules in a conversation*



comd: What new command do you think is that guy gonna push?

os module: Ofcourse the shutdown command :)

comd: I would have called this a funny joke if I was not raised with an **UnfunnyJokeExceptonError()**

os module: You guys just have a few bloody exceptions, I am a module strong enough to fight most exceptions

comd: Well I have solution for the exception too, **KillTheBloodyJokerLol()**

shutil module: guys calm down its 2022

os module: Look who's talking!

comd: That's the legendary shutil module

os module: Trying to overtake me lol

shutl module: Look os I....
